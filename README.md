## Overview
Iris is an UCI chess engine written in c++ that I started in April 2025. The name Iris derives from the flower iris, which symbolizes trust, hope, knowledge, and courage. The name also alludes to Iris, the goddess of the rainbow üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà.

## Usage
Iris doesn't come with a graphical user interface (GUI). To play against it, you have to download a chess GUI that supports the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol such as cutechess, en-croissant, etc.

## Build
Currently, you can only build Iris with `g++` that supports `c++ 20`.
```
git clone https://github.com/citrus610/iris
cd iris
make
```
